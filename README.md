COVID-19 Country-Wise Data Analysis using Jupyter Notebook

# COVID-19 Country Wise Data Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19's impact across different countries using data from the `country_wise_latest` dataset. The analysis includes confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and trends over time. Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are used for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning: Handling duplicates and missing values
- Visualization: Top 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases
- Understanding trends: Distribution of deaths, recoveries, and more

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report) 

## Note: The dataset file (`country_wise_latest.csv`) should be placed in the root directory of the project if you plan to run it locally.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
